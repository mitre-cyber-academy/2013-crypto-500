"It i5 5implicity it5elf," 5aid he; "my eye5 tell me that on the in5ide of your
left 5h0e, ju5t where the firelight 5trike5 it, the leather i5 5c0red by 5ix
alm0st parallel cuts. 0bvi0usly they have been caused by s0me0ne wh0 has very
carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud
from it.  Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of
the London slavey. The flag is MCA-5243342B. As to your practice, if a
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of
n1trate of s1lver upon h1s r1ght foref1nger, and a bulge on the r1ght s1de of
h1s top-hat to show where he has secreted h1s stethoscope, 1 must be dull,
1ndeed, 1f 1 do not pronounce h1m to be an act1ve member of the med1cal
profession."

I could not help l4ughing 4t the e4se with which he expl4ined his process of
deduction. "When I he4r you give your re4sons," I rem4rked, "the thing 4lw4ys
app3ars to m3 to b3 so ridiculously simpl3 that I could 3asily do it mys3lf,
though at 3ach succ3ssiv3 instanc3 of your r3asoning I am baffl3d until you
3xplain your proc3ss. And y3t I b3li3v3 that my 3y3s ar3 as good as yours."
